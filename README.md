# Dracon

built around sensible and natural-feeling YAML extensions.

# Configuration Library for Extended YAML Parsing

Dracon is a modular configuration system for Python that extends YAML (leveraging the awesome `ruamel.yaml` YAML parser/emitter). It provides advanced features for configuration files, including:

- üìÇ Inclusion of other configuration files and variables.
- üîÑ Extended merge syntax for complex data merging.
- üßÆ Interpolation of Python expressions within the configuration.
- üß© Resolvable nodes for deferred construction and advanced manipulation.
- üõ†Ô∏è Automatic construction and instantiation of python objects using Pydantic.
- üñ•Ô∏è Command line programs configurable through files and command line arguments overrides.

## Features

### 1. Inclusion of Other Configuration Files and Variables

You can include external YAML files or variables directly within your configuration using the `!include` tag or the `*loader:` syntax.

#### Syntax

- **Using `!include` tag:**

  ```yaml
  settings: !include "file:config/settings.yaml"
  ```

- **Using `*loader:` syntax:**

  ```yaml
  settings: *file:config/settings.yaml
  ```

#### Supported loaders

- `file:` - Loads a file from the filesystem.
- `env:` - Loads an environment variable.
- `pkg:` - Loads a resource from a Python package.

You can also write a custom loader to support other sources.

#### Examples

**Including a file:**

```yaml
database: !include "file:config/database.yaml"
```

**Including an environment variable:**

```yaml
api_key: *env:API_KEY
```

**Including a package resource:**

```yaml
defaults: !include "pkg:my_package:configs/defaults.yaml"
```

**Including a specific key from an included file:**

```yaml
specific_setting: *file:config/settings.yaml@setting_key
```

### 2. Extended Merge Syntax

The library extends the YAML merge key `<<` to provide advanced merging capabilities with customizable behavior.

#### Merge Key Syntax

```yaml
<<{dict_options}[list_options]@keypath: value
```

- `{dict_options}`: Options for merging dictionaries.
- `[list_options]`: Options for merging lists.
- `@keypath`: Optional keypath to specify where to apply the merge.

#### Options

- **Modes:**
  - `+`: Append (recursive merge).
  - `~`: Replace.
- **Priorities:**
  - `<`: New value has priority.
  - `>`: Existing value has priority.
- **Depth:**
  - Numbers (e.g., `+2`) to limit the depth of recursion.

#### Examples

**Basic merge with append and existing value priority:**

```yaml
<<{+>}: *file:base.yaml
```

**Merge and replace with new value priority:**

```yaml
<<{~<}: *file:override.yaml
```

**Merge at a specific keypath:**

```yaml
<<{+>}@settings.database: *file:database_override.yaml
```

**Merging lists with append:**

```yaml
<<[+]: [item4, item5]
```

### 3. Interpolation of Python Expressions

Embed Python expressions within your YAML configuration using `${expression}` syntax. The expressions are evaluated at load time.

|[!WARNING]

> Use caution when using interpolation, especially when loading untrusted configuration files.
> Dracon uses asteval to add some guardrails, but it's not hackproof, just merely "foolproof" (and probably not even that - let's not underestimate ourselves).

#### Syntax

```yaml
value: ${python_expression}
```

#### Examples

**Basic arithmetic:**

```yaml
sum: ${2 + 2} # Evaluates to 4
```

**Using variables from the context:**

```yaml
greeting: ${'Hello, ' + @name + '!'}
name: "World"
```

**Accessing other configuration values using keypaths:**

```yaml
full_name: ${first_name + ' ' + @/last_name}
first_name: "John"
last_name: "Doe"
```

**Interpolating tags:**

```yaml
number: !${'int'} ${2.1 + 3.1}  # Evaluates to integer 5
```

#### Referencing values and fields in interpolation expressions:

Often, you may need to reference values from the final constructed object hierarchy. Sometimes, you also want to directly embed a node from the configuration tree. A useful example would be something like:

```yaml
__dracon__:
  # this is a special namespace that will be ignored by dracon.
  # Any top-level key starting with __dracon__* will be ignored.
  # It's meant for you to store anything you may want to reference later.
  # The loader will not attempt to construct them.
  simple_obj: &simple_obj
    index: ${i + 1} # this interpolation wouldn't properly work if the object was constructed before i was set
    name: "Name ${@index}" # this will reference the index field of the object. a &reference would also work.

# this will create a list of 5 objects, each one an instantiation of simple_obj with a different index:
all_objs: ${[&simple_obj for i in range(5)]}
```

Dracon provides two special syntaxes for this purpose:

##### @/path.to.value Symbol -> object reference

- Purpose: Includes values from the final constructed object hierarchy.
- Behavior: References may pull values that have been modified after the configuration is fully constructed, possibly even after modifications in Python code.
  [!WARNING]
  > If you want to lazy evaluate such a reference in a nested object hierarchy, your objects must implement the DraconLazy protocol (which will keep track of the root so that paths can be resolved later). Otherwise, the reference will consider the object it lives in as the root and you should probably only use relative paths.

##### &/path.to.value -> node copy

- Purpose: Includes and duplicates configuration nodes directly from the configuration tree before construction.
- Behavior: The duplication happens during the composition phase, before construction. This ensures that the node reflects the configuration as written, without any modifications that might occur during or after construction.

[!info]

> For now, `@` only supports keypaths, while `&` references work with both keypaths and anchors (e.g., `&anchor`). In case of conflicts (a local field member with the same name as an anchor), the anchor takes precedence.

### 4. Resolvable Nodes

Resolvable nodes allow deferred construction of objects, enabling advanced manipulation and custom processing before the final object is created.

#### Syntax

```yaml
object: !Resolvable[Type]
  attribute1: value1
  attribute2: value2
```

#### Examples

**Deferring the construction of a custom object:**

```yaml
person: !Resolvable[Person]
  name: 'Alice'
  age: ${30 + 5}
```

In your Python code, you can resolve the object when needed:

```python
resolved_person = config.person.resolve()
```

### 5. Custom Tags and Types

You can use type tags to specify custom Python classes for objects in your configuration. They will be resolved and validated using Pydantic.

#### Syntax

```yaml
custom_object: !my_module.MyClass
  attr1: value1
  attr2: value2
```

#### Example

**Using a custom class:**

```yaml
database_config: !my_project.config.DatabaseConfig
  host: "localhost"
  port: 5432
```

## Order of Operations and Processing Stages

Understanding the order in which the configuration is processed helps in predicting the final outcome. The processing involves several stages:

1. **Composition Phase:**

   - **Parsing YAML Nodes:** The YAML content is parsed into a tree of nodes.
   - **Recording Special Nodes:** Include nodes (`!include`) and merge nodes (`<<`) are recorded along with their keypaths.

2. **Include Processing:**

   - **Resolving Include Nodes:** Include nodes are processed, and their content is recursively composed.
   - **Merging Included Content:** The included content replaces the include nodes in the configuration tree.

3. **Merge Processing:**

   - **Sorting Merge Nodes:** Merge nodes are sorted to ensure that merges occur from the deepest nodes upwards.
   - **Applying Merges:** Merges are applied according to the specified options, modifying the configuration tree.

4. **Construction Phase:**
   - **Constructing Python Objects:** The nodes are transformed into Python objects.
   - **Interpolation:** Python expressions (`${...}`) are evaluated during object construction.
   - **Resolving Resolvable Nodes:** Resolvable nodes are constructed when their `resolve()` method is called.

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes:** The raw representation of the YAML content before construction.
- **Keypaths:** Paths that identify the location of nodes within the configuration tree.
- **Composition Result:** The state of the configuration after the composition phase, including the root node and recorded include and merge nodes.
- **Construction Result:** The final Python objects constructed from the nodes, after interpolation and processing.

## Usage Example

**config.yaml**

```yaml
# Include base settings
<<: *file:config/base.yaml

# Override a setting with interpolation
database:
  host: ${'db.' + env}

# Use a custom object
service: !my_project.ServiceConfig
  name: 'ExampleService'
  port: 8080
```

**Python Code**

```python
from dracon.loader import DraconLoader

# Create a loader instance
loader = DraconLoader()

# Load the configuration
config = loader.load('config.yaml')

# Access configuration values
print(config.database.host)
print(config.service.name)
```

### 6. Command Line Programs

Dracon provides utilities to generate command line programs from a simple Pydantic model. They fully leverage the configuration system and allow configuration file overrides and command line argument parsing.

```
Arg annotation:
        real_name: Optional[str] = None # autofill
        short: Optional[str] = None
        long: Optional[str] = None # default = real_name
        help: Optional[str] = None # help message, displayed with -h or --help
        arg_type: Optional[type] = None # autofill
        expand_help: Optional[bool] = False
        action: Optional[Callable[[ProgramType, Any], Any]] = None # function to call after initialization
        positional: Optional[bool] = False
        resolvable: Optional[bool] = False
        is_file: Optional[bool] = False
```

```yaml
# my_package/configs/default.yaml
database:
  host: "remotehost"
  port: 543
```

```yaml
# ./local_config.yaml
database:
    port: 5432
    user: *env:DB_USER
    password: *env:DB_PASSWORD
use_ssl: false
```

```python

from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import BaseModel
from dracon import Arg, make_program

class DatabaseConfig(BaseModel):
    host: str
    port: int
    user: str
    password: str

class MyProgramModel(BaseModel):
    database: Annotated[DatabaseConfig, Arg(
        help='Database configuration',
        short='d',
        expand_help=True,
    )]
    use_ssl: Annotated[bool, Arg(help='Use SSL for connection')]

    def run(self):
        # everything is already filled in (and validated by Pydantic)
        ...

prog = make_program(
    MyProgramModel,
    name='my-program',
    description='Description of my program.',
)
program_model, args = prog.parse_args(sys.argv[1:])

# program_model is an instance of MyProgramModel with all its fields filled
# example invocation (+path/to/file(.yaml)... syntax is used to load configuration files, merged in order)
# python my_program.py +pkg:my_package:configs/default +local_config.yaml --database.host localhost --use_ssl

assert program_model.database.host == 'localhost'
assert program_model.use_ssl == True
assert program_model.database.port == 5432

program_model.run() # call whatever method you want to run
```

|[!TIP]

> Sometimes you may need to have some member variable be parsed at a later stage (maybe because you need to define some context $variables that depend on other members first).
> That's where resolvable fields are useful. They suspend their construction until you call their `resolve(context={...})` method.

## Misc Advanced Features

### Lazy Interpolation

If a constructed object implements the DraconLazy protocol (easiest is probably to inherit from LazyDraconModel), any interpolable fields will be kept unevaluated until accessed.
When construcing a class that does not implement the DraconLazy protocol (like a vanilla dict for example), all interpolable fields will be evaluated immediately.

### Interpolating Tags and Values Together

You can interpolate both the tag and the value in a node:

```yaml
dynamic_value: !${'int'} ${2 + 3}  # Evaluates to integer 5
```

### Using Keypaths in Interpolation

Keypaths allow you to reference other parts of the configuration during interpolation:

```yaml
combined_value: ${@/some/other/value + 10}
```

### Customizing Merge Behavior

Control merge operations with depth limits and priority settings:

```yaml
# Limit merge recursion depth and set priorities
<<{+2<}[~>]: *file:config/partial_override.yaml
```
